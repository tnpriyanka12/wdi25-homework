## Simple Sums

Back to the world of Javascript! See if you can remember how it works...

Write a program that can calculate the sum of the first `n` elements of the following sequences (using normal counting, not zero indexation):

```js
s1 = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + //etc
s2 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + //etc
```
For example:

```js
s1(4) = 0
s2(4) = 10
```

Can you guess what the sum would be if n is infinity?
